				The unit is seconds, with a default interval of 1 minute. When the value is 0, auto save will be disabled.
				         When automatic save is disabled, only [c/FF0000:Death], [c/00FF00:Normal Exit Game], or [c/FFFF00:SSC Command] can trigger save!
				         If the value is too small, it will frequently trigger saving, requiring a certain bandwidth requirement.
